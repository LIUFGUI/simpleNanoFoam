simpleNanoFoam, an OpenFOAM-based package developed to modelling confined liquid flow in nanoporous media at the pore scale. 

This solver and some utilities were developed based on GeoChemFoam (https://github.com/GeoChemFoam), 
which is the world's most advanced open source pore-scale numerical simulator based on OpenFOAM founded 
at the Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering at Heriot-Watt University in 2019 by Dr Julien Maes and Dr Hannah Menke.
